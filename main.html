This information may be used to help you select your delivery address, to provide more accurate deliveries of your orders, to provide recommendations to you, and to enhance your user experience and improve the services. You can choose whether to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on your device or Platform or when prompted by the DoorDash mobile app. If you choose to disable the location feature, the Dasher will not receive precise location information from your device, which may compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in a large area, such as a park.</span></p>

Sometimes we offer a promotional value for every friend or family member who signs up and places an order through your referral link. To help you do this, we may request you to grant us access to your mobile device address book. You can then direct us to send referral emails to contacts you select in your address book. By sending a referral, you also consent to DoorDash sending your public profile image to the contacts you select to receive a referral link. By choosing to invite a friend you represent that you have received the friend’s consent to provide his or her name and email address with us. DoorDash will use that information to send an email inviting him or her to visit the site and will store that information to track the success of the referral program and may send marketing emails. You can also send an SMS with a referral link to your contacts. If you use this option, you understand that DoorDash does not control the timing, content, or recipients of these SMS messages.</span></p>

Such actions may violate various federal, state, and/or international laws, including, but not limited to, the regulations and policies promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. Users may not send any referral emails, SMS messages, or other communications to children under the age of 13.</span></p>

	<ul data-aura-rendered-by="118:2;a">
	 <li style="text-align: justify;"><i style="background-color: transparent;">Right to Know</i><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;– You have the right to know the Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell about you.</span></li>

Such profiles may enable delivery of interest-based advertising by such third parties within their platform or on other sites. Depending on how you use the Services, we may share the following categories of information for such interest-based advertising which may be considered a sale (as defined by the CPRA): (1) device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; and (2) connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage.

                <p>
                    When you use the Lyft Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and
                    information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like

                    other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:
                </p>

                    <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Account Registration.</strong> When you create an account with Lyft, we collect the
                        information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and
                        payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile,
                        like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as
                        your preferred pronouns).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the
                        information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number,
                        birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social
                        security number), driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance
                        information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing
                        numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for
                        additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and
                        programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point
                        after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or
                        Drivers, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The
                        Lyft Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending
                        on your Lyft app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform
                        as a Rider or Driver:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app,
                            including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until
                            it ends. Lyft also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including
                            while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect
                            precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride
                            incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer
                            active.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform,
                        including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and
                        whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information about your
                        interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content
                        you view and the dates and times of your use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access
                        the Lyft Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating
                        system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings
                        (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising
                        identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor
                        data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
                        technical data).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to
                        facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either
                        party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the
                        communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the
                        participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security
                        purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Lyft
                        Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access
                        to your contact lists and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer
                        friends to Lyft. If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of
                        the people in your address book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information
                        through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like
                        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google Analytics</a>, SDKs, and
                        other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft Platform and
                        interact with Lyft advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what content is
                        popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save
                        your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are
                        designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may
                        use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close
                        your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                        time you use the Lyft Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie
                        settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss

                <p>
                    We do not sell your personal information. To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share your
                    personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains
                    when and why we share your information.
                </p>
                <section id="privacy-sharing-between-users">
                    <h3>A. Sharing Between Lyft Users</h3>
                    <p><strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Rider information shared with Driver:</em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the
                        Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like
                        approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their
                        Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the
                        Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app. Once
                        the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver.
                        (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with
                        Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Driver information shared with Rider:</em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will
                        share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time
                        location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in
                        the Driver’s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why
                        you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not
                        share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a
                        lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver,
                        including sharing actual contact information with your consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Rider’s
                        name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off
                        locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or
                        paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account, a
                        code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card
                        linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may
                        share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge,
                        rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them
                        know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information
                        about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a
                        bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive
                        such information.

                    We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide you and our other users the Lyft
                    Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We
                    retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we
                    can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. If you request
                    account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the “Deleting Your Account”
                    section below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no
                    security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information,
                    including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.

                    As explained more below and on our <a href="https://www.lyft.com/privacy/home">privacy homepage</a>,
                    Lyft provides ways for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise other
                    data rights that give you certain control over your personal information.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Email Subscriptions.</strong> You can always unsubscribe from our commercial or
                        promotional emails by clicking unsubscribe in those messages. We will still send you
                        transactional and relational emails about your use of the Lyft Platform.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Text Messages.</strong> You can opt out of receiving commercial or promotional text
                        messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may
                        also opt out of receiving all texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages)
                        by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. Note that
                        opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use of the Lyft Platform. Drivers can also opt
                        out of driver-specific messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS. To re-enable texts
                        you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.

                        your device settings. Please note that opting out of receiving push notifications may impact
                        your use of the Lyft Platform (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).

                        information through your device’s system settings. But if you do, this may impact Lyft’s ability
                        to provide you our full range of features and services.

                        <strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows

                        them to track your online activities. The Lyft Platform does not currently support Do Not Track
                        requests at this time.

                        will be unable to delete your account, such as if there is an issue with your account related to
                        trust, safety, or fraud. When we delete your account, we may retain certain information for
                        legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. For example, we
                        may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain
                        your information as part of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways
                        designed to prevent its use for other purposes.

                <p>
                    When you use the Lyft Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and
                    information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like

                    other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:
                </p>

                    <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Account Registration.</strong> When you create an account with Lyft, we collect the
                        information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and
                        payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile,
                        like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as
                        your preferred pronouns).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Driver Information.</strong> If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the
                        information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number,
                        birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social
                        security number), driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance
                        information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing
                        numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for
                        additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and
                        programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point
                        after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Ratings and Feedback.</strong> When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or
                        Drivers, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Location Information.</strong> Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The
                        Lyft Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending
                        on your Lyft app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform
                        as a Rider or Driver:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Lyft app,
                            including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until
                            it ends. Lyft also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including
                            while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect
                            precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride
                            incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer
                            active.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your use of the Lyft Platform,
                        including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and
                        whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information about your
                        interactions with the Lyft Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content
                        you view and the dates and times of your use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access
                        the Lyft Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating
                        system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings
                        (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising
                        identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor
                        data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
                        technical data).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Communications Between Riders and Drivers.</strong> We work with a third party to
                        facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either
                        party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the
                        communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the
                        participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security
                        purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Lyft
                        Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Address Book Contacts.</strong> You may set your device permissions to grant Lyft access
                        to your contact lists and direct Lyft to access your contact list, for example to help you refer
                        friends to Lyft. If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of
                        the people in your address book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies.</strong> We collect information
                        through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like
                        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google Analytics</a>, SDKs, and
                        other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft Platform and
                        interact with Lyft advertisements, to make your Lyft experience safer, to learn what content is
                        popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save
                        your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are
                        designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may

                        your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                        time you use the Lyft Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie
                        settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss

                <p>
                    We do not sell your personal information. To make the Lyft Platform work, we may need to share your
                    personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains
                    when and why we share your information.
                </p>
                <section id="privacy-sharing-between-users">
                    <h3>A. Sharing Between Lyft Users</h3>
                    <p><strong>Riders and Drivers.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Rider information shared with Driver:</em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the
                        Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like
                        approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their
                        Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the
                        Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Lyft app. Once
                        the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver.
                        (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with
                        Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Driver information shared with Rider:</em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will
                        share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time
                        location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in
                        the Driver’s Lyft profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why
                        you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not
                        share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a
                        lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver,
                        including sharing actual contact information with your consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Shared Ride Riders.</strong> When Riders use a Lyft Shared ride, we share each Rider’s
                        name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off
                        locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others.</strong> Some rides you take may be requested or
                        paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Lyft Business Profile account, a
                        code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card
                        linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may
                        share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge,
                        rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Referral Programs.</strong> If you refer someone to the Lyft Platform, we will let them
                        know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information
                        about your use of the Lyft Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a
                        bonus when you join the Lyft Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive
                        such information.

                    Platform. This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We
                    retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we
                    can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. If you request
                    account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the “Deleting Your Account”
                    section below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We take reasonable and appropriate measures designed to protect your personal information. But no
                    security measures can be 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information,
                    including against unauthorized intrusions or acts by third parties.

                    Lyft provides ways for you to access and delete your personal information as well as exercise other

                        messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. You may
                        also opt out of receiving all texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages)
                        by texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the messages. Note that
                        opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use of the Lyft Platform. Drivers can also opt

                        will be unable to delete your account, such as if there is an issue with your account related to
                        trust, safety, or fraud. When we delete your account, we may retain certain information for
                        legitimate business purposes or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. For example, we
                        may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain
                        your information as part of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways
                        designed to prevent its use for other purposes.

					<p><strong>4.5 Complying with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protecting our Rights</strong>.</p>
					<p>We may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, tax authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with a valid legal request or to respond to claims asserted against Airbnb, (iii) to respond to a valid legal request relating to a criminal investigation to address alleged or suspected illegal activity, or to respond to or address any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal or regulatory liability (more information on Airbnb’s Law Enforcement Guidelines <a href="/help/article/960/how-does-airbnb-respond-to-data-requests-from-law-enforcement">here</a>), (iv) to enforce and administer our <a href="/terms">agreements</a> with Members, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Airbnb, its employees, its Members, or members of the public.

					<p>Where appropriate, we may notify Members about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon or harm to Airbnb, our Members, or expose Airbnb to a claim of obstruction of justice.</p>
					<p>For jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and remittance of Taxes where legally permissible according to applicable law, we may disclose Hosts’ and Guests’ information about transactions, bookings, Accommodations and occupancy Taxes to the applicable tax authority, such as Host and Guest names, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received (or due) by Hosts from Guests, and contact information.</p>
					<p>In jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates or requires a registration, notification, permit, or license application of a Host with a local governmental authority through Airbnb in accordance with local law, we may share information of participating Hosts with the relevant authority, both during the application process and, periodically thereafter, such as the Host’s full name and contact details, Accommodation address, tax identification number, Listing details, and number of nights booked.</p>
					<p><strong>4.6 Programs with Managers and Owners</strong>.</p>

In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. Occasionally we may need to manually review communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools.

					<p><strong>5.3 Third-Party Partners &amp; Integrations</strong>.</p>
					<p>Parts of Airbnb may link to third-party services, not owned or controlled by Airbnb, such as Google Maps/Earth.
